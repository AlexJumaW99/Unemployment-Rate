# Unemployment-Rate
A data analysis program that allows one to visualize the unemployment rate in the United States in each state.
The pandas library is used to read the data, which in this case is a csv file, as well as analyze and manipulate it.
The Folium library enables us to carry out web mapping by creating a choropleth map, in this case the map only has one layer.
A legend is used for interpretation of the map data. 

NB: The output can be found in the map1.html file.
